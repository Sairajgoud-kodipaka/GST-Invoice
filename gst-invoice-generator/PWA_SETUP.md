# PWA Setup Guide

This application has been configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing users to install it on their devices and use it offline.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Web App Manifest** (`/public/manifest.json`)
- App name, description, and icons
- Standalone display mode
- Theme colors
- App shortcuts for quick access

### 2. **Service Worker** (Auto-generated by next-pwa)
- Offline caching for better performance
- Network-first caching strategy
- Automatic service worker registration

### 3. **Install Prompt**
- Custom install prompt component (`components/pwa/InstallPrompt.tsx`)
- Appears when the browser supports PWA installation
- Respects user dismissal preferences

### 4. **PWA Metadata**
- Proper meta tags for iOS devices
- Apple touch icons
- Theme color configuration

## How It Works

### Installation
1. Users can install the app from the browser's install prompt
2. Or use the custom install prompt that appears on supported browsers
3. Once installed, the app appears as a standalone application

### Offline Support
- The service worker caches network requests
- Previously visited pages work offline
- API calls use network-first strategy (tries network, falls back to cache)

### Configuration

The PWA is configured in:
- `next.config.ts` - PWA plugin configuration
- `public/manifest.json` - App manifest
- `app/layout.tsx` - PWA metadata and links
- `components/pwa/InstallPrompt.tsx` - Install prompt component

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: PWA is disabled for faster builds (`disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`)
- **Production**: PWA is fully enabled with service worker and caching

## Testing

1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
3. Open in a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
4. Look for the install prompt or browser's install button
5. Test offline functionality by going offline after visiting pages

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Android)
- ✅ Safari (iOS 11.3+)
- ✅ Firefox (Limited support)
- ⚠️ Service worker works in all modern browsers

## Customization

### Icons
Update icons in `public/manifest.json` and ensure you have:
- 192x192 PNG icon
- 512x512 PNG icon
- SVG icon for better scaling

### Theme Colors
Update in:
- `public/manifest.json` - `theme_color` and `background_color`
- `app/layout.tsx` - `viewport.themeColor`

### Caching Strategy
Modify `runtimeCaching` in `next.config.ts` to change how resources are cached.

## Notes

- Service worker files are auto-generated in `public/` directory
- These files are gitignored (see `.gitignore`)
- The install prompt respects user preferences and won't show again if dismissed
